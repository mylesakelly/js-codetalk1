// for loops allow us to repeat the same action as many times as we want!
// instead of printing "i love pizza" 5 times individually, a for loop is more efficient.


const n = 5; 
// variable n is set to the value of 5

for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
// initialize for loop by setting variable i to 1
// 1 will be the beginning of the loop
// i <= n is the condition; so the loop will only run as long as i is less than or equal to n
// i++ is the counter; each time the loop runs the counter will increase the value of i by 1 until the condition is met.
    console.log(`I love pizza`);
// prints "I love pizza" to the consoe 5 times
